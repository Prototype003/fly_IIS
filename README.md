# fly_IIS
Processing and analysis code for manuscript "Integrated information structure collapses with anesthetic loss of conscious arousal in Drosophila melanogaster"

Extracting preprocessed trials (prerocessed data to be shared, probably via figshare) - see bin/main_postPuffPreStim_extract.m

Computing IIS using pyphi - see bin/fly_phi.py; bin/phi_3/phi_compute.py; bin/phi_3/bash_loop_compute.bash

Code here is a subset of a larger (currently private) repository with many (many) undirectly related files. So maybe there are some dependencies missing.
